            When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring design, learning new tools, or binge-listening to startup podcasts.

            WordLok is a 2D word puzzle game that challenges players to find all the letters in a 5-letter word before exhausting 11 moves. 
            Players are presented with a grid where the letters of the word are randomly placed among other letters. 
            After a brief memorization period, the letters are hidden, and players must recall their positions to succeed. 
            This game aims to improve vocabulary and memory in a relaxing, easy-to-play environment.
